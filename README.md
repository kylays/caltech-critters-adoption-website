# Caltech Critters Adoption
This project was created as a final project for CS 132 at Caltech in Spring 2022. I worked on the backend component with Clara Wang. Our shared code is found in the repo cs132-caltech-adoption-api. This repo includes some changes to that api and the front end for a fake adoption website with features like adding a new item (includes uploading an image), updating the API upon purchase, filtering animals by their species, and more!
