# Caltech Critters Adoption
This project was created as a full-stack final project for CS 132 at Caltech in 
Spring 2022 (with some minor updates since then for more features). I worked on 
the backend component with Clara Wang. Our shared code is found in the repo 
cs132-caltech-adoption-api. This repo includes some changes to that API and the 
front end for a single-customer fake adoption website with features like adding 
a new item (includes uploading an image), updating the API upon purchase, 
filtering animals by their species, and more! To see the website locally, clone 
this repo and run `npm install` and `node app.js`. Then direct your web 
browser to `localhost:8000/index.html`. See the website at https://caltech-critters-adoption.onrender.com/.
