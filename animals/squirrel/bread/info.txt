Bread is a playful squirrel. He loves scavenging for food in the trash. Make sure to feed him enough, or he will try to take your food, and will not give it back. Bread would do well in an environment without other squirrels so he won't become aggressive about food. Bread is pictured here outside of the Annenberg Center for Information Science and Technology.
